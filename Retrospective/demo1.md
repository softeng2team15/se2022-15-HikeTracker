RETROSPECTIVE (Team ***15***)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
- - 6 vs 3
- Total points committed vs. done 
- - 25 vs 9
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
- - 77 vs 76

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing 
- Code review completed 
- Code present on VCS 
- End-to-End tests performed 

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| #1    | 5       | 5      | 15         | 9            |

| #6    | 4       | 3      | 8          | 7            |


> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  

## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 4
  - Total hours spent 3


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? Overconfidence from last demo project, poor communication in the first half of the sprint, poor and rushed planning because of inability to be all present and unpredictable events(sickness etc.).

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? We learned that the most important aspect of working as a team is communication and also the importance of planning.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? We were able to improve a little bit in the division of work during planning, also we found a testing mechanism that is good for everybody.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? The communication between ends and we couldn't because of how we started the sprint

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.) Better planning, better communication between members (2 meeting per week to catch up) and get a configuration management schema that is helpful and is great for everybody

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!! We were ***self aware*** of our mistakes and we had ***accountability*** about them.
